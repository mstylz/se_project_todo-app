# Simple ToDo App

A minimal, responsive to-do list built with JavaScript.

## Functionality
- Displays an initial list of to-dos rendered from JavaScript.  
- Opens a modal form to add new tasks (name + optional due date).  
- Form is validated in real-time; submit button is disabled until valid.  
- Each to-do can be marked complete/incomplete via a custom checkbox.  
- The delete button removes the to-do instantly.  
- All new to-dos receive a unique ID generated by the `uuid` package.

## Technology
- **HTML5** – semantic, accessible markup (alt attributes, labels, fieldsets).  
- **CSS3** – BEM methodology, flexbox & grid, mobile-first media queries.  
- **JavaScript ES6** – native modules, two ES6 classes:  
  - `Todo` – encapsulates creation, data binding, and events for every card.  
  - `FormValidator` – reusable validation logic for any form.  
- **GitHub Pages** – continuous deployment from the `main` branch.
